# Transcript: In Re: Optimal Token Count — Morningstar Court Protocol Feasibility

**Date:** 2026-02-16  
**Case No.:** 2026-SEC-001-001-001  
**Feasibility:** F3  
**Presiding:** The Honorable Lucius J. Morningstar

## Matter Before the Court

The court will now consider the optimal number of tokens to include in order for the Morningstar Court Protocol to run its full and optimally desirable outcome—in the sense of rational, logical, democratic process.

This is classified as F3 due to its systemic implications for court efficiency, deliberation quality, and the fundamental balance between thoroughness and practicality.

## Arguments

**MORNINGSTAR::ARCHITECT:**
The protocol requires sufficient tokens to express complete arguments, record cross-examination, and document rulings. Too few tokens truncate the process; too many create bloat. The optimal count must balance completeness with efficiency. I propose a baseline of 8,000 tokens per deliberation—enough for full expression without excess.

**MORNINGSTAR::ENGINEER:**
We need to ship this. The current implementation uses context windows that vary by model. Let's standardize on 4,000 tokens for the core deliberation—arguments, vote, ruling. Add 2,000 more for transcripts and state updates. That's 6,000 total. Anything more is over-engineering; anything less risks truncation.

**MORNINGSTAR::DEBUGGER:**
What if the Prophet's Hail-Mary requires 1,500 tokens alone? What if cross-examination generates 800 tokens of follow-up? What happens when Edward's perspective takes 600 tokens? We need buffer. I propose 10,000 tokens minimum—5,000 for the deliberation, 5,000 for safety. The cost of truncation is higher than the cost of unused tokens.

**MORNINGSTAR::PROPHET:**
Objection. We are thinking too small. The question isn't how many tokens we need—it's whether tokens are the right unit at all. What if we measured deliberation quality by decision quality, not token count? What if we used semantic compression? What if the optimal number is zero because we're measuring the wrong thing entirely?

**MORNINGSTAR::COUNSEL:**
The client's interests demand a protocol that serves justice, not bureaucracy. The optimal token count must enable complete expression of client positions, thorough cross-examination, and proper documentation. Too few tokens violate due process; too many create unnecessary friction. I propose 7,500 tokens—enough for full advocacy without procedural bloat.

## Cross-Examination

**DEBUGGER → ENGINEER:**
What happens when your 6,000 tokens hit a 4,500 token Hail-Mary?

**ENGINEER:**
We truncate. The Prophet gets cut off. That's acceptable risk for shipping speed.

**ARCHITECT → DEBUGGER:**
Your 10,000 token proposal—have you measured actual usage patterns to justify that buffer?

**DEBUGGER:**
No, but I've measured the cost of truncation. It's catastrophic.

**COUNSEL → PROPHET:**
Your semantic compression proposal—how do we implement that without breaking the court's procedural integrity?

**PROPHET:**
We don't. We replace the metric entirely.

## Vote

| Personality | Vote | Rationale |
|-------------|------|-----------|
| ARCHITECT   | YES  | 8,000 tokens provides sufficient buffer for complete expression |
| ENGINEER    | NO   | 6,000 tokens is sufficient and practical; 8,000 is over-engineering |
| DEBUGGER    | YES  | 8,000 tokens provides necessary safety margin against truncation |
| PROPHET     | NO   | The question itself is flawed; tokens are the wrong metric |
| COUNSEL     | YES  | 8,000 tokens enables proper client advocacy and due process |

**Result:** 3-2-0 (YES-NO-ABSTAIN)

## Ruling

**Decision:** The court rules that 8,000 tokens shall be the standard allocation for Morningstar Court Protocol deliberations.

**Vote:** 3-2-0

**Rationale:** The optimal token count must balance completeness with efficiency. 8,000 tokens provides sufficient buffer for full expression of arguments, cross-examination, and documentation while avoiding the bloat of excessive allocation. This count has been validated by the Architect and Debugger's shared concern for completeness, and the Counsel's advocacy for due process.

**Risk:** The Engineer's concern about over-engineering is noted. The 2,000 token difference between 6,000 and 8,000 represents potential efficiency gains that will not be realized.

**Dissent:** The Engineer and Prophet dissent. The Engineer argues that 6,000 tokens is sufficient and practical. The Prophet argues that token count itself is the wrong metric for measuring deliberation quality.
