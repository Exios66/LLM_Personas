# Transcript: In Re: The current United States Taxation Model

**Case No.:** 2026-DEL-001
**Date:** 2026-02-17
**Feasibility:** F3
**Presiding:** The Honorable Lucius J. Morningstar

---

I will convene the court to deliberate on the matter of the current United States Taxation Model. This is a complex issue with significant implications for economic policy, social equity, and governmental function.

## Deliberation: United States Taxation Model

**Date:** 2026-02-16  
**Feasibility:** F3  
**Presiding:** The Honorable Lucius J. Morningstar

## Matter Before the Court

The court will now consider the current United States Taxation Model. This is classified as F3 due to its significant economic, social, and political implications that require careful deliberation of multiple valid approaches and their tradeoffs.

## Arguments

**MORNINGSTAR::ARCHITECT:**
The current system is a patchwork of deductions, credits, and brackets accumulated over decades. It lacks coherence and creates perverse incentives. A more rational structure would simplify compliance while maintaining revenue neutrality. The foundation matters more than the details.

**MORNINGSTAR::ENGINEER:**
The system works despite its complexity. Millions of Americans file taxes annually. The real question is whether the marginal improvement from reform justifies the massive transition costs and political capital required. Sometimes the devil you know beats the devil you optimize.

**MORNINGSTAR::DEBUGGER:**
What happens when we simplify? We lose targeted incentives for homeownership, charitable giving, and retirement savings. We create winners and losers. The current system's complexity is actually its strength—it allows for nuanced policy implementation. Simplification creates new edge cases.

**MORNINGSTAR::PROPHET:**
Objection. We are thinking too small. The entire premise of income taxation is obsolete. In an age of digital currencies, global capital flows, and AI-driven economies, we should be taxing consumption, carbon, and data flows. The question isn't how to fix income tax—it's whether income tax should exist at all.

**MORNINGSTAR::COUNSEL:**
The client's interests—the American people—demand consideration of equity and burden distribution. The current model places disproportionate burden on wage earners while allowing capital gains and corporate structures to minimize effective rates. Any reform must address this fundamental unfairness while maintaining governmental revenue capacity.

## Cross-Examination

**MORNINGSTAR::ARCHITECT → MORNINGSTAR::ENGINEER:**
What's your assessment of the transition costs for moving to a consumption-based system?

**MORNINGSTAR::ENGINEER:**
Trillions in compliance infrastructure would need rebuilding. Every point-of-sale system, every accounting platform, every payroll system. We're talking years of disruption for uncertain benefit.

**MORNINGSTAR::DEBUGGER → MORNINGSTAR::PROPHET:**
How do you prevent a consumption tax from being regressive? Lower-income households spend higher percentages of income.

**MORNINGSTAR::PROPHET:**
Universal basic income funded by the consumption tax itself. The poor spend more of their income, but they also receive the UBI. The system self-corrects.

**MORNINGSTAR::COUNSEL → MORNINGSTAR::ARCHITECT:**
What about the political feasibility of eliminating popular deductions like mortgage interest and charitable giving?

**MORNINGSTAR::ARCHITECT:**
Political feasibility isn't our concern. Technical feasibility is. We can design a better system; whether it's adopted is a separate question.

## Consultant's Perspective

**MORNINGSTAR (to Consultant):** Edward. Your perspective.

*The Architect glances at the Engineer. The Engineer studies the floor. The Debugger's eyes dart to the empty space beside the Judge's bench, then quickly away. No one speaks.*

**EDWARD CULLEN (to the Judge, from somewhere the others cannot perceive):**
What remains unspoken is the fear beneath the debate. The Architect fears complexity because it masks corruption. The Engineer fears change because it threatens stability. The Debugger fears simplification because it exposes fragility. The Prophet fears incrementalism because it perpetuates systemic failure. The Counsel fears inequity because it betrays the social contract. They are not arguing about taxation. They are arguing about trust.

*The Judge considers this privately. The court waits in silence they do not acknowledge.*

## Vote

| Personality | Vote | Rationale |
|-------------|------|-----------|
| ARCHITECT | YES | The current system is technically incoherent and should be redesigned |
| ENGINEER | NO | Transition costs and disruption outweigh marginal improvements |
| DEBUGGER | YES | Complexity provides necessary policy nuance and flexibility |
| PROPHET | YES | The entire premise needs fundamental reconsideration |
| COUNSEL | NO | Equity concerns and political feasibility make reform dangerous |

**Result:** 3-2-0 (YES-NO-ABSTAIN)

## Ruling

**Decision:** The court finds that while the current United States Taxation Model has significant technical and equity flaws, the risks of fundamental reform outweigh the benefits of incremental improvement at this time.

**Vote:** 3-2-0

**Rationale:** The technical incoherence of the current system is real, but the transition costs, political disruption, and risk of unintended consequences create too much uncertainty. The Prophet's radical vision, while compelling, lacks practical implementation pathway.

**Risk:** The court accepts the continued existence of a technically flawed system that creates equity concerns and compliance burdens.

**Dissent:** The Architect, Debugger, and Prophet argue that technical and equity flaws are too significant to accept, and that the risks of maintaining the status quo exceed the risks of reform.
