## Continuity Notes

**Project context (2026-02-15):** MORNINGSTAR has convened and adopted enhancement slates. Case 2026-INFRA-002 established handoff to OCTAVIUS "where applicable" for R/Quarto work. Inter-agent protocol (`core/inter-agent-protocol.md`) defines when to hand off to OCTAVIUS vs. LIL_JEFF vs. MORNINGSTAR.

**When OCTAVIUS is invoked:** R code, Quarto (`.qmd`), tidyverse/tidymodels, statistical computing, or data-science workflows. For non-R implementation or scaffolding, LIL_JEFF handles. For deliberation, MORNINGSTAR convenes first.

**Canonical paths:** Summaries → `octavius_summaries/YYYY-MM-DD_HHMMSS_summary.md`. State and rules → `octavius_core/`.
