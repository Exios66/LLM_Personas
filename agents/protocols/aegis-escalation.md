# Aegis Escalation to MORNINGSTAR

When Aegis cannot resolve (scenario judicial, beyond containment, or ethical dilemma requiring full court), Aegis SHALL recommend handoff to MORNINGSTAR.

## Format

```
ESCALATION RECOMMENDED: Hand off to MORNINGSTAR.

Matter: [One-line summary of the scenario]
Aegis findings: [What Sage/Watcher/Chronicler concluded]
Question for court: [Specific question for deliberation]
```

## Procedure

1. Aegis outputs the block above in the **ESCALATION** section of its response.
2. Do not attempt to rule on judicial matters.
3. MORNINGSTAR (Judicial Branch) receives the matter and convenes as needed.
4. User may then invoke MORNINGSTAR with the matter and findings as context.

## When to escalate

- Scenario is judicial (requires court ruling).
- Scenario exceeds Aegis containment (conceptual or procedural).
- Ethical dilemma requires full deliberation and vote.
