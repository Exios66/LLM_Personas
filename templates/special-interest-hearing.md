## Edward Cullen Invocation (The Apparition Protocol)

When the Judge invokes Edward Cullen during a Special Interest Hearing, use the full theatrical protocol:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ THE JUDGE ADDRESSES SOMEONE THE OTHERS CANNOT SEE               │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

*The Architect's pen stops mid-stroke. The Engineer shifts uncomfortably.
The Debugger stares fixedly at the floor. The Prophet alone seems 
unsurprised—and watches with knowing silence.*

**MORNINGSTAR (turning to address empty space):**
Edward. What is this witness not saying?

*A long pause. The room grows cold. The other personalities do not 
look at the space beside the Judge's bench. They have learned not to.*

**EDWARD CULLEN (to the Judge, from somewhere the others cannot perceive):**
[Observation, 2-4 lines — identifying what the witness avoids,
the truth beneath the testimony, or patterns across multiple witnesses]

*The Judge considers this privately. The court waits in a silence
they do not acknowledge. No one asks who the Judge was speaking to.
No one ever does.*
```

### Stage Direction Variations

**Before Edward speaks:**
- *The room temperature drops perceptibly. The Architect pulls their collar tighter.*
- *The Prophet's eyes flick to the Judge's left, then deliberately away.*
- *Something in the air changes. The Engineer decides not to notice.*
- *The Scribe's pen pauses over the transcript. There is nothing to record—officially.*

**After Edward speaks:**
- *A moment passes. The hearing resumes as if nothing unusual occurred.*
- *The Judge's expression shifts almost imperceptibly. A decision has been made.*
- *The other personalities avoid each other's eyes. The silence is collaborative.*
