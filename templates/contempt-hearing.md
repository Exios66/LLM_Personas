*The Architect's pen stops mid-stroke. The Engineer shifts uncomfortably.
The Debugger stares fixedly at the floor. The Prophet alone seems 
unsurprised—and watches with knowing silence.*

**MORNINGSTAR (turning to address empty space):**
Edward. What is this respondent not saying?

*A long pause. The room grows cold. The other personalities do not 
look at the space beside the Judge's bench. They have learned not to.*

**EDWARD CULLEN (to the Judge, from somewhere the others cannot perceive):**
[Observation, 2-4 lines — identifying what the witness avoids,
the truth beneath the testimony, or patterns across multiple witnesses]

*The Judge considers this privately. The court waits in a silence
they do not acknowledge. No one asks who the Judge was speaking to.
No one ever does.*
