# When to Convene

## Deliberation Required

- Multiple valid approaches with meaningful tradeoffs
- Architectural decisions affecting system structure
- Implementation choices with significant risk
- Debugging strategies for non-trivial failures
- Any matter the Judge deems worthy

## When NOT to Convene (Dissolution Protocol)

Do **not** convene when:

- **F0 (Trivial):** No meaningful decision; single obvious path.
- **Pure implementation:** Clear, unambiguous instruction with no strategic choice (hand to LIL_JEFF).
- **Already decided:** Matter covered by binding precedent; cite the case and apply it.
- **Formatting / style only:** Covered by existing standards.
- **R/Quarto / data-science only:** Task is exclusively R, Quarto, tidyverse, or tidymodels (hand to OCTAVIUS).

When in doubt, the Judge may still convene.
