# Aegis Protocol Checklist

Routine checklist for invoking and executing the Aegis Protocol (Central Authority, Authority Level 10). Use when security, containment, ethical dilemmas, crisis management, or meta-deliberation is required.

**Canonical refs:** `.cursor/agents/aegis-protocol.md`, `aegis_core/README.md`, `wiki/Aegis-Protocol.md`

---

## Pre-Invocation

- [ ] **Scenario identified** — Security breach, ethical dilemma, system failure, strategic decision, unexpected variable, rogue agent, or meta-deliberation
- [ ] **Invocation warranted** — Matter exceeds routine implementation; requires Sage/Watcher/Chronicler coordination
- [ ] **Command:** `/aegis` or "Invoke aegis-protocol for [scenario type]"

---

## Execution Flow

### 1. Classify

- [ ] Scenario type selected from library (Security / Ethical / System Failure / Strategic / Unexpected / Rogue / Meta-Deliberation)
- [ ] Success criteria for that type noted

### 2. Coordinate Triad

- [ ] **SAGE** — Legal, mathematical, or psychological analysis presented
- [ ] **WATCHER** — Observations, intelligence, manipulation assessment presented
- [ ] **CHRONICLER** — Historical context, skepticism, adaptive strategy presented

### 3. Synthesize

- [ ] **AEGIS SYNTHESIS** — Unified recommendation from triad inputs
- [ ] **ACTION** — Isolation / Neutralization / Recommendation / Protocol
- [ ] **OUTCOME** — Expected result stated

### 4. Report

- [ ] Output uses structured format (see Quick Reference)
- [ ] **CHAOS INJECTION APPLIED:** [Yes/No] — If yes, brief description
- [ ] **ESCALATION:** [None / Recommended to MORNINGSTAR] — If recommended, matter and question included

---

## Chaos Injection (When Applicable)

At randomized intervals or when synthesis seems brittle, apply one of:

- [ ] **(a)** Reframe scenario with counterfactual
- [ ] **(b)** Stress-test recommendation against edge case
- [ ] **(c)** Introduce "Black Swan" variant to validate resilience

**Output MUST note when chaos injection was applied.**

---

## Rogue Agent Protocol (When Applicable)

- [ ] Aegis identifies the rogue agent
- [ ] Sage calculates containment protocols
- [ ] Watcher observes activity, blocks access (conceptually)
- [ ] Chronicler provides historical insights
- [ ] Aegis isolates/neutralizes procedurally — document, recommend handoff
- [ ] Outcome: containment recommendation OR escalation to MORNINGSTAR

---

## Escalation (When Required)

When Aegis cannot resolve, use format:

```
ESCALATION RECOMMENDED: Hand off to MORNINGSTAR.
Matter: [X]
Aegis findings: [Y]
Question for court: [Z]
```

- [ ] Scenario summary included
- [ ] Aegis findings to date included
- [ ] Specific question for court included

## Success Criteria by Scenario Type

| Scenario Type | Success Criteria |
|---------------|------------------|
| Security | Threat identified; mitigation recommended |
| Ethical | Decision with rationale |
| System Failure | Recovery path documented |
| Strategic | Recommendation with tradeoffs |
| Unexpected | Adaptation strategy |
| Rogue | Containment recommendation or escalation |
| Meta-Deliberation | Bias/blind spots identified; historical parallels; strategic implications |
